                <p>
                    The designs shown are a part of a group project I was a member of. Our team had the opportunity of collaborating together to work with and design for the Eau Claire County Department of Human Services. They are a city department that helps individuals and families in need to positively impact their lives, while contributing to the well being of the community. Our team came in to help rebrand the department, reflecting what they do. As a team we created a new mark, posters, brochures, and hybrid pieces. We chose to use a color palette that would provide diversity and energy. We particularly chose saturated colors to create a welcoming feel. Each color in the mark represents a different service provided within Eau Claire County department of Human Services.
