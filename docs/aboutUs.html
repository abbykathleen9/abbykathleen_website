                    <h1>Our Story</h1>
                    <p>
                        Thomas and Peggy Randall are the owners of S&D Wholesale. They were married in 1970, after Tom returned from serving in Vietnam. They have two children, Scott and Debbie. Tom has been a successful businessman for decades. Before 1987, he owned Augusta Feed, had a bulk-fuel oil business, and even had his children selling Christmas trees each year in Augusta, Wisconsin. In 1988, their next business opened, The Woodshed. They sold local and American Amish furniture, along with American Made and overseas d√©cor.

                        They were both surprised by the stores success and decided to open up two more Amish furniture stores in Wisconsin. While The Woodsheds were in business, they also owned a local restaurant, gas station, and continued to operate Augusta Feed. In 1997, they started their wholesale business (while continuing to run the Woodshed), S&D Wholesale. Their wholesale business mainly sells to other retail business. They have been selling their products at wholesale and retail shows throughout the United States, since 1997. They sold Augusta Feed to their son Scott, in 2001. In 2015, Tom and Peggy sold The Woodshed. Today they only operate S&D Wholesale. They enjoy semi-retirement by spending time with their grandchildren, going to auctions, dancing, and traveling.
