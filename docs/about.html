					<p>
						<b>Hello!</b> I am Abby Kathleen Randall, a graphic designer and painter based in Eau Claire, Wisconsin.
						I have placed my main focus on branding, typography, and composition.<br><br>

						I grew up in a small town, with my mom, dad, brother, and grandparents.
						Family is very important to me. 
						My Great-Grandmother is a talented painter who inspired me to pursue art.<br><br>
						
						Fall 2016 I started college at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire. 
						I completed my Bachelor's Degree in Graphic Communications in Spring 2020.<br><br>
						
						My first post-graduate job was as an Print Advertising Technician at Menards. 
						Each week, as a team we finished a weekly flyer. 
						I used Adobe InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop, and Lago. 
						I handle stress and deadlines well, and was given the opportunity to design the most looked at pages, covers and backs.<br><br>
						
						In July 2022, I became a Promotions Graphic Designer at Menards.
						As the only designer on the team, I have become a strong problem solver and creative innovator. 
						My tasks include creating company-wide benefit guides, posters, and vehicle sweepstake graphics. 
						I work closely with major racing outlets to make digital and print materials. 
						In addition, I archive historical company materials and am a personal Graphic Designer for the company President.<br><br>
						
						In my freetime I enjoy kayaking, crafting, pop culture, and spending time with the people I love.
					</p>

					<!-- <p>
						As a young child, I was always passionate about art. 
						I attended a small high school where I was known for being an artistic student. 
						I loved to draw, paint and create collages. 
						Throughout my life, my family has encouraged my artistic passion.<br><br>

						I was always interested in art, but was worried it was not a viable career choice. 
						Within my first semester at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire, I changed my major several times, but always went back to art. 
						I decided to Major in Graphic Communications. I made myself familiar with Adobe products and worked hard to become a better designer.<br><br>

						Graphic Design has created new opportunities for me. 
						I love solving my clients design problems. 
						It feels rewarding to see something I made printed, posted on social media or on television.<br><br>
					
						Art is all around us and I will continue to contribute my designs.
