                        As a young child, I was always passionate about art. I attended a small high school where I was known for being an artistic student. I loved to draw, paint and create collages. Throughout my life, my family has encouraged my artistic passion.

                        I was always interested in art, but was worried it was not a viable career choice. Within my first semester at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire, I changed my major several times, but always went back to art. I decided to Major in Graphic Communications. I made myself familiar with Adobe products and worked hard to become a better designer.

                        Graphic Design has created new opportunities for me. I love solving my client’s design problems. It feels rewarding to see something I made printed, posted on social media or on television.

                        Art is all around us and I will continue to contribute my designs.

                    <p>
                        From Fall, 2017 to Spring, 2020 I worked at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire, at the Campus television station, TV-10. Since Fall, 2018, I have been TV-10's Creative Director and Lead Graphic Designer.

                        As Creative Director I lead a team of up to 25 TV-10 members. My job included teaching each Creative Team Member the basics of Adobe Premiere, how to use the station equipment and assigned them a project each week. As a director I attended meetings, met with clients and reviewed assigned projects.

                        As the Lead Graphic Designer, I created graphics for the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire’s athletic broadcasts shown on local television station, WEAU. I have also made printed and digital materials for TV-10’s All-Nighter, a 48 hour movie marathon. Elements included logo designs, posters, table tents, social media designs, Snapchat geofilters, attending weekly meetings, setting up film equipment and team collaboration.
