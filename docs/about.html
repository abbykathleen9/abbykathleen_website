                        As a young child, I was always passionate about art. I attended a small high school where I was known as being an artistic student. I loved to draw, paint, and create collages. Throughout my life, my family has encouraged my artistic passions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I always knew I wanted a career in the arts but was worried it was not a serious career choice. Within my first semester at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire, I changed my major several times, but always went back to art. I decided to pursue a career in Graphic Communications. I made myself become familiar with Adobe products and worked hard to become a better designer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After diving into this major, I have appreciated graphic design has the possibility to use mixed medias, pull from different interests. As a designer, I love solving my client’s design problems. It is rewarding to see something I created on social media or on-air. It is so satisfying and humbling, especially to know others will see what I created.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Art is all around us and I will continue to contribute my designs to the world.
